The goal of the assignments is to develop your computational skills while learning the essential stochastic methods.

You will be handing in homeworks as Ipython notebooks. Your ipython notebook should be runnable from beginning to end.

You **MUST** provide explanations for all answers that you wrote. Writing code is not enough. Imagine you are explaining the subject to a knowledgeable peer: thats how your homeworks should read. And, please, **comment** your code.

You should hand in one solution per person, but you are encouraged to work in groups of three or less for the homework and final project. Collaboration means you work together; it does not mean you split the work. Each student is expected to work on all homeworks and all questions. All code should be your own.
 
An ISite with a dropbox will be provided for your homework and project submissions. The dropbox for each homework and project will close on the deadline for that piece of work. NO work will be accepted after the deadline. Do not submit in the last seconds before the dropbox closes.

We understand, however, that medical factors may occasionally interfere with your ability to participate or to hand in work on time. If that factor is an extenuating circumstance, we will ask you to provide documentation.

If you believe there is an error in your assignment grading, please submit an explanation via email to us  within 3 days of receiving the grade. No regrade requests will be accepted orally, and no regrade requests will be accepted more than 3 days after you receive the grade for the assignment.
