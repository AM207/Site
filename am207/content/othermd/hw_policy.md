Students are encouraged to work in groups of three or less for the homework and final project. Collaboration means you work together; it does not mean you split the work. Each student is expected to work on all homeworks and all questions. You should hand in one solution per group, but you should all work on all problems together.

The goal of the assignments is to develop your computational skills while learning the essential stochastic methods.
 
There will be 10 problem sets during the semester.  Problem sets are handed out weekly (on Thursday) and are due the following Thursday, at 11.59PM, unless otherwise announced.
 
An isite with a dropbox will be provided for your homework and project submissions. The dropbox for each homework and project will close on the deadline for that piece of work. NO work will be accepted after the deadline. Do not submit in the last seconds before the dropbox closes.

Each student is given 4 late days for homework at the beginning of the semester. A late day extends the individual homework deadline by 24 hours without penalty. No more than two late days may be used on any one assignment. Assignments handed in more than 48 hours after the original deadline will NOT be graded.

Late days are intended to give you flexibility: you can use them for any reason - no questions asked. You don't get any bonus points for not using your late days. Also, you can only use late days for the individual homework deadlines, and not for your project (see below)

We understand, however, that medical factors may occasionally interfere with your ability to participate or to hand in work on time. If that factor is an extenuating circumstance, we will ask you to provide documentation directly issued by the University, and we will try to work out an agreeable solution with you (and your teammates).

If you believe there is an error in your assignment grading, please submit an explanation via email to us  within 3 days of receiving the grade. No regrade requests will be accepted orally, and no regrade requests will be accepted more than 3 days after you receive the grade for the assignment.
