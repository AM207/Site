In addition to the homework there will be a final project. The final project schedule is on the projects link of the website.

You will be expected to produce a written paper (no longer than 6 pages), a screencast, and a poster to showcase your project. You can write the paper in the ipython notebook if you prefer.

All code and data (of reasonable size) used for the project must also be submitted. This may be in ipython notebooks, or separate files. If data is large, tell us where to find it. If its proprietary, talk to us ahead of time.

If you wish to use a language other than Python, talk to the TAs first.

**BONUS** You are also encouraged to make a web site for your project. If you do this, we will **drop** your worst homework in calculating your homework grade, and grade your web site instead. This does not mean you can skip doing a homework: you have to do them all. But this does mean that you do get a chance to improve your grade!

The dropbox for the project will close on the deadline for that piece of work. NO work will be accepted after the deadline. Do not submit in the last seconds before the dropbox closes.
