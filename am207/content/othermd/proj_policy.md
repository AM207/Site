In addition to the homework there will be a final project. The final project will be done over a period of 5 weeks, the first two of which will be concommitant with homeworks. In these two weeks, you will be expected to come up with and submit a proposal for the final project. There will be no homework for the last three weeks of the course, so as to provide you ample time to work on your project.

You will be expected to produce a written paper and a poster to showcase your project. All code used for the project must also be submitted.

The dropbox for the project will close on the deadline for that piece of work. NO work will be accepted after the deadline. Do not submit in the last seconds before the dropbox closes.
