Title: Policies

#### General Policy

At the beginning of the class, you will be given the URL of the course website.
All materials, lecture notes, lab notebooks, and examples will be put there.
 Homework deadlines and project report/poster dates will also be put on this website.

It is strongly recommended that you attend all the lectures. While lecture notes and lab notebooks will be posted online, do not expect all the material talked about in class, as well as questions posed and their answers to be in these notes.  Finally, the course is heavily based on examples, and we will demonstrate a lot of the methods with these examples during class.

You are not required to attend labs, but doing so will be helpful both in furthering your understanding and in doing your homework.

There will be a piazza page for all discussions and announcements. Participation in these discussions counts 5\% towards your grade.

You must acknowledge any source code that was not written by you by mentioning the original author(s) directly in your source code (comment or header). You can also acknowledge sources in a README.txt file if you used whole classes or libraries. Do not remove any original copyright notices and headers. However, you are encouraged to use libraries, unless explicitly stated otherwise!

You may use examples you find on the web as a starting point, provided its license allows you to re-use it. You must quote the source using  proper citations (author, year, title, time accessed, URL) both in the source code and in any publicly visible material. 

 
#### Accommodations for students with disabilities:

Students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must present their Faculty Letter from the Accessible Education Office (AEO) and speak with me by the end of the second week of the term to identify, discuss, and document any feasible instructional modifications or accommodations. Failure to do so may result in inability to respond in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential, although I may contact AEO to discuss appropriate implementation.
