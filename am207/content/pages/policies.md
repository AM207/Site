Title: Policies
Author: Pavlos Protopapas

### General Policy

At the beginning of the class, you will be given the URL of the course website.
All materials, lecture notes, lab notebooks, and examples will be put there.
 Homework deadlines and project report/poster dates will also be put on this website.

Lectures are being videotaped. It is strongly recommended that you attend all the lectures, as they will be fun. Lecture notes and lab notebooks will be posted online, do not expect all the material talked about in class, as well as questions posed and their answers to be in these notes.  Finally, the course is heavily based on examples, and we will demonstrate a lot of the methods with these examples during class.

Attending the labs will be helpful both in furthering your understanding and in doing your homework.


### Course Grade


<p class="text-primary">
Your course grade is calculated as:

<ul>
	<li>60% Homeworks </li>
	<li>5% Participation </li>
	<li>35% Final project </li>
</ul>
</p>

There will be a piazza page for all discussions and announcements. Participation in these discussions, as well as coming to class (for non-extension students) counts 5% towards your grade.

### Originality and Plagiarization

You must do your own work, we have zero-tolerance for plagiarization. 

You must acknowledge any source code that was not written by you by mentioning the original author(s) directly in your source code (comment or header). You can also acknowledge sources in a README.txt file if you used whole classes or libraries. Do not remove any original copyright notices and headers. However, you are encouraged to use libraries, unless explicitly stated otherwise!

You may use examples you find on the web as a starting point, provided its license allows you to re-use it. You must quote the source using proper citations (author, year, title, time accessed, URL) both in the source code and in any publicly visible material. 

If you have any doubts about whether a library is ok to use in your work, please direct your question to one of the TFs.
 

### Homework Policy

**There will be 10 problem sets during the semester. Problem sets are handed out weekly (on Thursday, after class) and are due the following Wednesday, at 11.59PM, unless otherwise announced.**

### Accommodations for students with disabilities:

Students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must present their Faculty Letter from the Accessible Education Office (AEO) and speak with me by the end of the second week of the term to identify, discuss, and document any feasible instructional modifications or accommodations. Students from the extension school should contact the extension school disability office, see [here](http://www.extension.harvard.edu/resources/disability-services). Failure to do so may result in inability to respond in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential, although I may contact AEO to discuss appropriate implementation.
