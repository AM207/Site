### Grades

Course grade:

	60% Homeworks
	5% Participation
	35% Final project

The course will be taught using Python as the language of implementation. You are strongly encouraged to use Python for your project and homework.

### Topic
These are the topics which will be covered in class. The list below reflects a rough ordering of topics. The actual order will likely shift around a bit.

#### INTRODUCTORY MATERIALS 

1. Course logistics and a preview of all methods. Main motivations: Integration, simulation of distribution, probabilities (MLE and Bayes), optimization, dynamic process. 
1. Introductory materials: Probabilities, distributions, regression and some linear algebra.

#### BASIC MONTE CARLO METHODS

1. Review of random numbers, basic Monte Carlo and techniques to evaluate accuracy and precision.
1. Basic Monte Carlo with variance reduction. Comparison of different approaches and non-MC

#### BAYESIAN FORMALISM

1. Bayesian Formalism, priors, posteriors, MAP, marginal distributions.
1. Bayesian Regression, Generative Models, etc

#### MARKOV CHAIN MONTE CARLO (MCMC)

1. Markov model. MCMC, proof of detailed balance, multivariate MCMC.
1. Variance reduction in MCMC. More examples and comparisons. Techniques for determining mixing and convergence.
1. Gibbs sampling. 
1. More Gibbs sampling and data augmentation.

#### ADVANCED MCMC METHODS 

1. Slice MC and multivariate Slice MC
1. Hamiltonian MC
1. Multi Nest and Emcee, parallel tempering


#### OPTIMIZATION

1. Simulated Annealing
