### Course Grade

<p class="text-primary">
Your course grade is calculated as:

<ul>
	<li>60% Homeworks </li>
	<li>5% Participation </li>
	<li>35% Final project </li>
</ul>
</p>

There will be a piazza page for all discussions and announcements. Participation in these discussions, as well as coming to class (for non-extension students) counts 5% towards your grade.

The course will be taught using Python as the language of implementation. You are strongly encouraged to use Python for your project and homework.

### Homeworks

There will be 10 problem sets during the semester. Problem sets are handed out weekly (on Thursday, after class) and are due the following Wednesday, at 11.59PM, unless otherwise announced.

### Labs

We will have 12 labs during the semester given on Friday at 11:00am-12:30pm. The goal of the labs is to go through some real world problems while reviewing the material from class. The labs will be helpful in doing the homework: you are strongly encouraged to attend. Since the lab also does real world applications, it will help you do your project.

### Projects

In addition to the homework there will be a final project. The final project will be done over a period of 5 weeks, the first two of which will be concommitant with homeworks. In these two weeks, you will be expected to come up with and submit a proposal for the final project. There will be no homework for the last three weeks of the course, so as to provide you ample time to work on your project.

You will be expected to produce a written paper and a poster to showcase your project. All code used for the project must also be submitted.

### Topics

These are the topics which will be covered in class. The list below reflects a rough ordering of topics. The actual order will likely shift around a bit.

#### INTRODUCTORY MATERIALS 

1. Course logistics and a preview of all methods. Main motivations: Integration, simulation of distribution, probabilities (MLE and Bayes), optimization, dynamic process. 
1. Introductory materials: Probabilities, distributions, regression and some linear algebra.

#### BASIC MONTE CARLO METHODS

1. Review of random numbers, basic Monte Carlo and techniques to evaluate accuracy and precision.
1. Basic Monte Carlo with variance reduction. Comparison of different approaches and non-MC

#### BAYESIAN FORMALISM

1. Bayesian Formalism, priors, posteriors, MAP, marginal distributions.
1. Bayesian Regression, Generative Models, etc

#### MARKOV CHAIN MONTE CARLO (MCMC)

1. Markov model. MCMC, proof of detailed balance, multivariate MCMC.
1. Variance reduction in MCMC. More examples and comparisons. Techniques for determining mixing and convergence.
1. Gibbs sampling. 
1. More Gibbs sampling and data augmentation.

#### ADVANCED MCMC METHODS 

1. Slice MC and multivariate Slice MC
