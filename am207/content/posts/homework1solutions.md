Summary: Solutions to homework 1.

**NOTE** : Question 3 is run for $10^5$ samples rather than $10^8$ so that it finishes in reasonable time, if you choose to run this notebook. Note I also illustrate there the importance of measuring such times multiple times, one can use the `%%timeit` cell magic in ipython.
