Summary: A tentative schedule of labs for the semester

We will have 12 labs during the semester given on Friday at 11:00am-12:30pm. The goal of the labs is to go through some real world problems while reviewing the material from class. The labs will be helpful in doing the homework: you are strongly encouraged to attend. Since the lab also does real world applications, it will help you do your project.
