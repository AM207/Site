Guo et. al. did a project on [Bayesian Evidence](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75194/2013Projects/AM207_GR_MARION_DIERICKX_XINYI_GUO_PHILIP_MOCZ_PROJECT.pdf).

Sawaya et. al. did a project on [fitting molecular structure](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75194/2013Projects/AM207_GROUP_NS_SB_MB_FinalPaper.pdf) using Bayesian Linear Regression And Gaussian Processes.

Isakov et. al used simulated annealing and other optimization to help with [urban planning](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75194/2013Projects/Bracher_David_AM207_FinalProject_BracherIsakov.pdf).

David Levary set up an (ultimately not very successful) bayesian model to [model stock picks](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75194/2013Projects/Levary207Paper.pdf). Its fine to be experimental like that: the method counts, the results may not be stellar.

Stephanie modelled [population growth forecasts](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75194/2013Projects/svalleau_am207_final_report.pdf) from different countries using a Bayesian model.

These are just some examples. Almost all topics taught in class were used.
