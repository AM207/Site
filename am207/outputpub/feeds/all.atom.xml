&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be 10 problem sets during the semester. Problem sets are handed out weekly (on Thursday, after class) and are due the following Wednesday, at 11.59PM, unless otherwise announced.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Homework Policies&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the assignments is to develop your computational skills while learning the essential stochastic methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be handing in homeworks as Ipython notebooks. Your ipython notebook should be runnable from beginning to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should hand in one solution per person, but you are encouraged to work in groups of three or less for the homework and final project. Collaboration means you work together; it does not mean you split the work. Each student is expected to work on all homeworks and all questions. All code should be your own.
 
An ISite with a dropbox will be provided for your homework and project submissions. The dropbox for each homework and project will close on the deadline for that piece of work. NO work will be accepted after the deadline. Do not submit in the last seconds before the dropbox closes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understand, however, that medical factors may occasionally interfere with your ability to participate or to hand in work on time. If that factor is an extenuating circumstance, we will ask you to provide documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you believe there is an error in your assignment grading, please submit an explanation via email to us  within 3 days of receiving the grade. No regrade requests will be accepted orally, and no regrade requests will be accepted more than 3 days after you receive the grade for the assignment.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="homeworks"></category></entry><entry><title>Installing Python</title><link href="http://iacs-courses.seas.harvard.edu/courses/am207/blog/installing-python.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-01-29T17:13:16-05:00</updated><author><name>Rahul Dave</name></author><id>tag:iacs-courses.seas.harvard.edu/courses/am207,2014-01-29:blog/installing-python.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;All the labs and homeworks in this course are Python-based. This page provides information about configuring Python on your machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 0&lt;/strong&gt; 
The IPython notebook runs in the browser, and works best in Google Chrome. You probably want to use Chrome for assignments in this course&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommended Method: Anaconda&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Anaconda Python distribution is an easily-installable bundle of Python and many of the libraries used throughout this class. It includes numpy/scipy/matplotlib/pandas/scikit-learn and other numerical libraries. Unless you have a good reason not to, we recommend that you use Anaconda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Mac/Linux users&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the &lt;a href="http://continuum.io/downloads"&gt;appropriate version&lt;/a&gt; of Anaconda&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the instructions on that page to run the installer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test it out: open a terminal window, and type &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt;, you should see something like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Python&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.7.5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Anaconda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.6.1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x86_64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Jun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2013&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;Anaconda&lt;/code&gt; doesn't appear on the first line, you are using a different version of Python. See the troubleshooting section below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test out the IPython notebook: open a Terminal window, and type &lt;code&gt;ipython notebook&lt;/code&gt;. A new browser window should pop up. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click &lt;code&gt;New Notebook&lt;/code&gt; to create a new notebook file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update IPython to the newest version by typing &lt;code&gt;conda update ipython&lt;/code&gt; at the command line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Windows Users&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the &lt;a href="http://continuum.io/downloads"&gt;appropriate version&lt;/a&gt; of Anaconda&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the instructions on that page to run the installer. This will create a directory at &lt;code&gt;C:\Anaconda&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test it out: start the Anaconda launcher, which you can find in &lt;code&gt;C:\Anaconda&lt;/code&gt; or, in the Start menu. Start the IPython notebook. A new browser window should open. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click &lt;code&gt;New Notebook&lt;/code&gt;, which should open a new page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update IPython to the newest version by opening a command prompt, and typing &lt;code&gt;conda update ipython&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Opening IPython Notebooks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To view an IPython notebook, you must first start the IPython notebook server in the directory where the file lives. Simply navigate to this directory at the command prompt, and type &lt;code&gt;ipython notebook&lt;/code&gt;. This will open a browser window, listing all the &lt;code&gt;ipynb&lt;/code&gt; files in that directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem&lt;/strong&gt;
When you start python, you don't see a line like &lt;code&gt;Python 2.7.5 |Anaconda 1.6.1 (x86_64)|&lt;/code&gt;. You are using a Mac or Linux computer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason&lt;/strong&gt;
You are most likely running a different version of Python, and need to modify your Path (the list of directories your computer looks through to find programs). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;
Find a file like &lt;code&gt;.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;.profile&lt;/code&gt;. Open the file in a text editor, and add a line at this line at the end: &lt;code&gt;export PATH="$HOME/anaconda/bin:$PATH"&lt;/code&gt;. Close the file, open a new terminal window, type &lt;code&gt;source ~/.profile&lt;/code&gt; (or whatever file you just edited). Type &lt;code&gt;which python&lt;/code&gt; -- you should see a path that points to the anaconda directory. If so, running &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; should load the proper version&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this doesn't work (typing &lt;code&gt;which python&lt;/code&gt; doesn't point to anaconda), you might be using a different shell. Type &lt;code&gt;echo $SHELL&lt;/code&gt;. If this isn't &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt;, you need to edit a different startup file (for example, if if &lt;code&gt;echo $SHELL&lt;/code&gt; gives &lt;code&gt;$csh&lt;/code&gt;, you need to edit your &lt;code&gt;.cshrc&lt;/code&gt; file. The syntax for this file is slightly different: &lt;code&gt;set PATH = ($HOME/anaconda/bin $PATH)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem&lt;/strong&gt;
You are running the right version of python (see above item), but are unable to import numpy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason&lt;/strong&gt;
You are probably loading a different copy of numpy that is incompatible with Anaconda&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;
See the above item to find your &lt;code&gt;.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.profile&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; file. Open it, and add the line &lt;code&gt;unset PYTHONPATH&lt;/code&gt; at the end. Close the file, open a new terminal window, type &lt;code&gt;source ~/.profile&lt;/code&gt; (or whatever file you just edited), and try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem&lt;/strong&gt;
Under Windows, you receive an error message similar to the following: "'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason&lt;/strong&gt;
The correct Anaconda paths might not be present in your PATH variable, or Anaconda might not have installed correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;
Ensure the Anaconda directories to your path environment variable ("\Anaconda" and "\Anaconda\Scripts").  See &lt;a href="http://superuser.com/questions/284342/what-are-path-and-other-environment-variables-and-how-can-i-set-or-use-them"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this does not correct the problem, reinstall Anaconda.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="homeworks"></category><category term="labs"></category></entry><entry><title>Lecture 0</title><link href="http://iacs-courses.seas.harvard.edu/courses/am207/blog/lecture-0.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-01-29T17:13:16-05:00</updated><author><name>Pavlos Protopapas</name></author><id>tag:iacs-courses.seas.harvard.edu/courses/am207,2014-01-29:blog/lecture-0.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A video of this lecture is available &lt;a href="http://cm.dce.harvard.edu/2014/02/24104/L01/index_H264SingleHighBandwidth-16x9.shtml"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="mr.-anderson-and-am207-a-preview-of-whats-coming.-i.e.-how-am207-will-help-you-survive-more-than-interviews-and-job-talks"&gt;Mr. Anderson and AM207: A preview of what's coming. i.e. How AM207 will help you survive more than interviews and job talks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story begins in 1981. Mr Anderson was traveling on a twin engine plane for the richness of South America. His brother, Jeffrey, has made a lot of money finding gold in the Andean mountains. Jeffrey was the adventurous type; he dropped out of high school and followed a friend who was going down to South America. He returned 10 years later a very rich man. Mr Anderson on the other hand stayed at school and then went to one of the most prestigious universities in North America -- Harvard University -- where he studied computational science under the famous Prof Provlief. These studies never got Mr Anderson any money, fame or even popularity. He was a loner, shy and very uncomfortable with people he did not know. What nowadays people might call a nerd, back then people was termed "peculiar".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="picture"&gt;
&lt;img align="middle" src="images/harvard.jpeg" width="400"&gt;
&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduating from Harvard, he took odd jobs at different places in Boston but none of them satisfied his curiosity or his intellect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he heard that the mining companies in the desert of Atacama were looking for bright young people to uncover the riches of nitrite (and having the requisite very good understanding of engineering and mathematics) he decided to take the risk and go down there to make his fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long trip to Lima, Peru, he boarded a twin engine that would take him to San Pedro in the middle of the desert, the driest place on earth; even lizards dreamed of spa treatments out there. Half way through the trip they were crossing a high pass of the Andes above the desert. He could look down from his window upon the infinite desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div id="picture"&gt;
&lt;img align="middle" src="images/TwinEngine.png" width="400"&gt;
&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt; It was then that he realized that one of the engines was on fire. He informed the pilot, who told him not to worry as they could continue on the other engine. But all of the sudden the other engine stopped operating. The pilot was quick to jump out of the plane with the only chute that was available. Ready to die, Anderson sat on the seat and quickly came to the realization that life was all about luck. He remembered the words of his professor telling him about &lt;strong&gt;randomness&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;div id="picture"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/atacama.jpg" width="400"&gt;
&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; The plane went down very fast and luckily landed on the soft sand (lizards and spa treatments will do that to the sand). Mr. Anderson had survived despite the impossible odds. &lt;strong&gt;"There is always that small probability and if you do not simulate things properly, you will miss those outliers"&lt;/strong&gt;, he remembered his wise professor telling him. "My professor was so right", he thought.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He got out of the plane, and dusted himself off. Happily concluding that nothing was broken and that he had survived a plane crash, he started examining the surroundings. There was absolutely nothing around. No water, no food and it was still hot and dry. "I will not survive", he thought. The voice of his professor was in his head though. "There is always that small little probability, the world is &lt;strong&gt;ergodic&lt;/strong&gt; and if you search hard enough and smart enough you can get everywhere in your search space." Right about now, he wished that he knew what ergodic meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He took out his handy old GPS device (an old version of GPS) and started walking west hoping he could get to the coast. He knew the coast was hundred of kilometers away but he would try to use any information he had to his benefit. He also took with him all medical supplies and whatever else he could get his hands on that seemed useful.&lt;/p&gt;
After 3 hours of trekking exhausted, thirsty and about to collapse, he saw something that looked like a water. He ran and indeed, there was a little pond. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;div id="picture"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/lake.jpeg" width="400"&gt;
&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'How lucky I am', he thought. He was ready to drink when he realized that there was a sign "Poison, do not drink". He looked into the medical supplies for he remembered there was something resembling an antidote for poisonous water.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="picture"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/poison.jpg" width="100"&gt;
&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He got it out and read the instructions. One drop per cubic meter of water. Do not use more. Excess use can have severe side effects, such as blindness. Mr. Anderson has to calculate the volume of the water. Luckily the pond seem to have a constant depth of about the length of his palm, which he knew was 30 cm (because even though he grew up in the US using imperial units, when in South America, do as the South Americans do and use metric!). He knew he had to somehow calculate the volume of the water in the pond. How though? Now he remembered a trick that he learned back in Harvard under Professor Provlief. First he formed a square on the sand using his body as a measuring stick. Next he(as randomly as he could) threw stones onto the square. By measuring the number of stones that landed in the water vs the total number of stones he had thrown, he was able to calculate the area of the pond and therefore the volume of the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A_{pond} = \frac{N_{in}}{N_{total}} A\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continued his westward direction, however all of sudden a sand storm started and visibility became very limited; he could not see anything now and had hard time breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="picture"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/desert-survival-8.jpg" width="400"&gt;
&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He knew if he could go to the highest point on the landscape he would have a much better chance in surviving. But without seeing the task of finding the highest point was impossible. Luckily again, his old professor had taught him how to find the maximum in a parameter space, which seemed to be perfectly appropriate for his situation. Remembering his professor's explanation, he took a few steps in a random direction and determined if his vertical position went up or down. If he stepped downwards he reversed his position and tried again, otherwise he continued from the new position. He remembered and incorporated from his old lectures a point about being willing every now and then to accept bad positions (i.e. going downwards vertically) to avoid being stuck at local maxima. Following this procedure, three hours later he was able to find the high ground and saved his life once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="picture"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/mcmc.png" width="400"&gt;
&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stayed at high ground for a while until the sand storm passed. Unfortunately, now it was cloudy and he could not see the sun. During the sand storm he lost his sense of directionality. He still had the old GPS but also found a pedometer that could provide him with estimates of his speed and with some basic astronomy he knew he could approximately find the direction. Starting to walk westward he faced the dilemma: should he trust the old GPS or should he trust the pedometer and his estimations? All of sudden he remembered Prof. Provlief lectures on Kalman filters. He remembered that this was a way to find out which one to believe more. Using the Kalman's gain he was able to maintain course and after a few more hours of walking he saw the far lights of a little village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\hat{X}_k = K_k \, Z_k +(1-K_k) \hat{X}_{k-1}\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="picture"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/kalman_filter.jpg" width="400"&gt;
&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I am saved!!" he thought. He started running towards the lights but when he arrived closer, he realized that this was not civilization as he was hoping for. This was a small dwelling out in the country with a few people sitting around the fire playing some kind of game. They looked like outlaws, certainly not to be trusted. He had no other choice but to approach them. He was hungry, tired, had not slept or had water for few days...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="picture"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/outlaws.jpg" width="400"&gt;
&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Anderson asked for water but the characters of the camp told him that in the desert nobody gives you water; you have to earn it. Next they invited him to join them in a game of dudo, a game similar to poker but played with dice. Mr Anderson knew nothing about the game but quickly realized after a bit of observation that it is all based on probability theory. After few rounds, he realized that all the players were using strategies derived from calculating probabilities based on commutative probability and extreme value distributions. Thanks to a little project he did with Prof. Provlief he had a small computer program that used Markov Chain Monte Carlo to calculate complicated integrals of probability distributions. Luckily the program that he used for the project was still on his Texas Instrument calculator that had survived the crash. Quickly he modified the code and soon after he started to win round after round. As winner of the game, he left the camp with water, food and a horse. He was feeling good about himself and all the time he spent with Prof. Provleif. Again it had saved his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="picture"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/perudo.jpg" width="400"&gt;
&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the horse now, he continued his journey trying to get out of the desert and still determined to make a lot of money before returning home. After a day of riding he came upon a little mining village. He was ecstatic to eventually be in a place where he could eat a hot meal, take a bath and rest a little before continuing on his quest to become rich. He checked into a local hotel and went for dinner at a local bar called the Empanadillas Caliente. He sat down at the bar next to a big strong man -- Mr. Jimenez was his name. He asked Mr. Jimenez what he was doing and was told that he was a mining engineer looking for iodine. Apparently there was a lot of demand for this mineral as a result of the rapidly expanding business of photography (iodine is an essential ingredient in film). Mr Jimenez was looking to find ways to extract iodine from nitrate but so far had only found failure. Nitrate and iodine were naturally to be found in mixed pools but nobody knew how to locate the pools. People could only use sonars to find the mineral cores but sonar wasn't sufficient to distinguish between the two. After couple of piscos, he again went back to his memory banks of the lectures of Prof. Provlief to recall that expectation maximization could be used to deduce the values of things not directly observed. He continued conversing with Mr. Jimenez and quickly realized that the methods he learned can be applied to the problem of extracting iodine. This led to a vivid discussion between the two technically savvy people while they downed a lot of piscos. By the morning they had figured out the likelihood function, and on his little calculator he was able to run the code and estimate the amount of iodine vs nitrate on many of the possible reservoirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="picture"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/EM.jpeg" width="400"&gt;
&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next few months they worked intently to perfect the method and started a new iodine exploration company. Their new company started making money and soon Mr. Anderson had enough money to feel very good about things. His dream was coming together - finally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="picture"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/washing.jpg" width="400"&gt;
&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly it turns out that he had started to feel comfortable too soon. His relationship with Mr. Jimenez went bad after the first few months. It turned out that Mr. Jimenez was not so honest with his dealings and he made Mr. Anderson sign a bad contract. Mr. Anderson, trusting that Mr. Jimenez was his friend and had his best interests in mind, did this without the proper due diligence. Mr. Anderson ended up up with only a dozen thousand dollars and completely out of the company. Totally disappointed but at least with a little cash in his pocket he took the first plane out of South America to London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="picture"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/london-attractions.jpg" width="400"&gt;
&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His first priority was to hit the local pub. There he met Mr. Muray who was working at a financial firm in equity trading. Mr. Anderson and Mr. Muray become friends over a warm beer at the pub. Mr Muray was talking away about the intricacies of trading and again Mr. Anderson once again connected back to the ever-influential Prof. Provlief's lectures on Hidden Markov Models and how to simulate sequential events of hidden variables. Quickly he pulled his little computer and started calculating. Long story short Mr. Anderson now lives a comfortable existence as a multimillioner trading on wall street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell vbox"&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Project Policies&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the homework there will be a final project. The final project will be done over a period of 5 weeks, the first two of which will be concommitant with homeworks. In these two weeks, you will be expected to come up with and submit a proposal for the final project. There will be no homework for the last three weeks of the course, so as to provide you ample time to work on your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be expected to produce a written paper and a poster to showcase your project. All code used for the project must also be submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dropbox for the project will close on the deadline for that piece of work. NO work will be accepted after the deadline. Do not submit in the last seconds before the dropbox closes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="projects"></category></entry><entry><title>Schedule of Labs</title><link href="http://iacs-courses.seas.harvard.edu/courses/am207/blog/schedule-of-labs.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-01-29T17:13:16-05:00</updated><author><name>Rahul Dave</name></author><id>tag:iacs-courses.seas.harvard.edu/courses/am207,2014-01-29:blog/schedule-of-labs.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We will have 12 labs during the semester given on Friday at 11:00am-12:30pm. The goal of the labs is to go through some real world problems while reviewing the material from class. The labs will be helpful in doing the homework: you are strongly encouraged to attend. Since the lab also does real world applications, it will help you do your project.&lt;/p&gt;
