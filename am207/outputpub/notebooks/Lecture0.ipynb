      "The story begins in 1981. Mr Anderson was traveling on a twin engine  for the richness of South America. His brother, Jeffrey,  has made a lot of money finding gold on the Andean mountains.  Jeffrey was the adventurous type, he dropped out of high school and followed a friend who was going down to South America. He returned back in 10 years a very rich man. Mr Anderson, stayed at school and then went to one of the most prestigious universities in North America, Harvard, where he studied computational science under the famous Prof Provlief. These studies never got Mr Anderson any money, fame or even popularity. He was a loner, shy and very uncomfortable with people he did not know. What nowadays people may may call a nerd, back then people called them peculiar. \n",

      "After a long trip to Lima, Peru, he boarded a twin engine that would take him to San Pedro  in the middle of the desert, driest place on earth; even lizards dried out here. Half way through the trip they were crossing a high pass of the Andes and over the desert. He could see down from his window the infinite desert. \n",

But all of the sudden the other engine stopped operating. The pilot was quick to jump out of the plane with the only one chute that was available.  Anderson was ready to die, sat on the seat and simply came to the conclusion that life was all about luck. He remembered the words his professor telling him about **randomness**. \n",

He was so right, he thought. \n",

Mr. Anderson has to calculate the volume of the water. Luckily the pond seem to have a constant depth of about the length of his palm, which he knew it was 30cm. He knew he had to calculate the volume of the water in the pond. How though? Now he remembers what he learned back in Harvard under professor Provlief. He form a square on the sand using his body as a measuring stick, throw stones in the air and by measuring the number of stones that landed in the water vs the total number of stones he was able to calculate the area of the pong and therefore the volume of the water. \n",

Luckily again, his old professor has taught him how to find the maximum in a parameter space, which seemed to be perfectly appropriate for his situation. Remembering his professor's explanation, he stepped in a random direction and feeling if he went up or down. If he stepped downwards he reserved his position and tried again otherwise he continue from the new position. Also he remembered from his lectures that every now and then he should be accepting bad positions, or going downwards in order to avoid local maxima. Following this procedure,  three hours later her was able to be at the high ground and saved his life once more. \n",

Unfortunately, now it was cloudy and he could not see the sun and during the sand storm he lost his sense of directionality. He had the old GPS but also found a pedometer that could provide him with estimates of his speed and with some basic astronomy he knew he could approximately find the direction. Started walking westward he faced the dilemma. Should he be trusting the old GPS or should he be trusting the pedometer and his estimations? All of sudden he remembered Prof. Provlief lectures on Kalman filters. He remembered that this was a way to find out which one to believe more. Using the Kalman's gain he was able to maintain course and in few hours of walking he saw in the far lights of a little village. \n",

He had no other choice but to approach them. He was hungry, tired, did not sleep or had water for few days. \n",

      "Mr Anderson asked for water but the characters of the camp told him that in the desert nobody gives you water; you have to earn it. Next they invited him to join them in a game of dudo, a game similar to poker but played with dice. Mr Anderson knew nothing of the game but quickly realized that it is all based on probability theory. After few rounds, he realized that all the players were calculating probabilities where the game is based on commutative probability and extreme value distributions. Thanks to a little project he did with Prof. Provlief he had  a small computer program using Markov Chain Monte Carlo to calculate complicated integrals of probability distributions. Luckily he had on his Texas Instrument calculator the program that he used for the project. Quickly he modified the code and soon after he started to win round after round. \n",

      "On the horse now, he continued his journey  trying to get out of the desert and still determined to make a lot of money before returning home. After a day of riding he came upon a little mining village. He was so happy to eventually be in a place he could take a hot meal and a bath. Rest and continue on his quest to become rich. He checked into a local hotel and went for dinner at a local bar called the empanadillas caliente. Sat down on the bar next to a big strong man, Mr. Jimenez was his name. He asked him what he was doing and he told him that he was a mining engineer looking for iodine. Apparently there was a lot of demand because of the expanding business of photography and iodine was used in films. Mr Jimenez was looking to find ways to extract iodine from nitrate only to be failing. He explained the problem as mixed pools of nitrate and iodine but nobody knew how to find where the pools were. They only had sonars that they used to find the core but could not distinguish between the two. After couple of piscos, he again remembered the lectures of Prof. Provlief about expectation maximization and how one can find out the values of things not directly observed but can be deduced. He continued conversing with Mr. Jimenez and quickly realized that the methods he learned can be applied here. This led to a vivid discussion between two technically savvy people while consuming a lot of piscos. By the morning they have figured out the likelihood function and on his little calculator he was able to run the code and estimate the amount of iodine vs nitrate on different possible reservoirs. \n",

At the end he ended with few dozen thousand dollars and out of the company. Totally disappointed but at least with a little cash he took the first plane out of South America to London. \n",

Mr Muray was talking about how trading was done and again he connected back to Prof. Provlief lectures on Hidden Markov Models and how to simulate sequential events of hidden variables. Quickly he pulled his little computer and started calculating. Long story short he is now a multimillioner trading on wall street.  "
